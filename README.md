# NYC-Taxi-Data
This project involved looking at detailed NYC Taxi data between 2017 and 2020 and developing a usable single page dashboard to analyze weekly trends. The data and cleaning requirements were provided for by Quantum Analytics NG and I used Microsoft Power BI to achieve it.
After a long list of cleaning requirements being carried out, I was able to generate the following insights:

Total Revenue
Total Trips
Average distance per trip
Maximum distance traveled etc

You'll find a lot more interesting insights when you go through the dashboard.
